Flixel v2.55 is finally ported!!!

This branch contains version which targets flash and cpp.
For flash it uses standart bitmap renderer and for cpp targer - hardware accelerated drawTiles renderer.
For differencies between these two render systems see https://github.com/Beeblerox/HaxeFlixel/wiki/Differences-between-Flash-and-CPP-render-systems

As a example, this branch contains port of Adam 'Atomic' Saltsman Mode Demo also.
