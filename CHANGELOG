flixel CHANGELOG

v1.02
------------------------------
* Ported FlxBar class
* Added FlxBitmapFont class
* Added PxButton class which uses FlxBitmapFont for text rendering
* Replaced Dynamic with appropriate types (where it was possible)
* Improvements in FlxQuadTree and FlxObject (less garbage)
* Changed rendering system for cpp target so it uses 2d tile transformations now (which means non-uniform scaling is working now)
* Changed TileSheet creation process to insert gaps between frames. This should solve 'pixel bleeding' problem

v1.01
------------------------------
* Finally ported FlxPreloader class
* Fixed issue with FlxTextFieldClass when it wasn't affected by fade() and flash() effects (on cpp and neko targets)
* Improvements in memory consumption for FlxTileBlock and FlxBitmapFont classes
* Updated lib to work with haxe 2.09
* Ported FlxGridOverlay from Flixel-Power-Tools

v1.00
------------------------------
* Initial haxelib release
